# Collection of Fabric Patterns

This repository features a small collection of patterns for use with the [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) framework. Read the documentation on their GitHub page for instructions on how to setup and use Fabric or check [this](https://optixsec.github.io/darkstar-blog/posts/unlock_the_power_of_large_language_models_how_to_download_and_install_fabric/) small guide I wrote.
